# Prediction of High Cost Patients

Machine learning project. 
Predicting the likely future healthcare costs of individuals across different social groups is an important and stimulating
computing challenge. To address the problem of controlling healthcare costs, we retrieved data from the MEPS dataset,
which contains general and medical information about 2000 patients collected during 2003 in the United States.
We modeled the task of predicting high cost patients as a binary classification problem.
